# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

REST API backend for a gym routine tracking application built with Node.js, Express, Prisma ORM, and SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production). Supports JWT authentication, role-based access control (ATHLETE/TRAINER), and full CRUD operations for workout routines and exercises. Trainers can manage multiple athletes and assign routines to them.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Production server
npm start

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Database operations
npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration_name>  # Create and apply migration
npx prisma generate                              # Regenerate Prisma Client
npx prisma studio                                # Open Prisma Studio GUI
npm run prisma:studio                            # Shortcut for Prisma Studio
npm run prisma:generate                          # Shortcut for generate
```

## Architecture

### Core Structure

- **Server**: `src/server.js` - Express app with security middleware (helmet, CORS, rate limiting)
- **Database**: `src/services/database.js` - Singleton PrismaClient instance
- **Auth**: `src/utils/auth.js` - JWT and bcrypt utilities
- **Middleware**: `src/middlewares/auth.js` - Token authentication (`authenticateToken`, `optionalAuth`)
- **Controllers**: `src/controllers/` - Business logic for auth and routines
- **Routes**: `src/routes/` - API endpoint definitions

### Database Schema (Prisma)

Five main models with cascading deletes:
- **User** (with Role: ATHLETE or TRAINER) â†’ has many **Routine**
- **Exercise** - Catalog of exercises (id, name, description)
- **Routine** - Workout routines with `userId` (owner) and `createdBy` (creator)
- **RoutineExercise** - Join table linking routines to exercises with sets, reps, rest, order
- **TrainerAthlete** - Join table for N:N relationship between trainers and athletes
- All relationships use `onDelete: Cascade`
- Database service is a singleton accessible via `databaseService.getClient()`

### Authentication Flow

1. JWT tokens generated with 7-day expiration (configurable)
2. Tokens include `issuer: "gym-backend"`, `audience: "gym-app"`, and `role`
3. Middleware extracts user from token and attaches to `req.user` (includes role) and `req.userId`
4. Role-based middleware `requireRole()` restricts endpoints by user role
5. Password hashing uses bcrypt with 12 rounds
6. Password validation requires: 6-128 chars, uppercase, lowercase, number

### Routine Management

- **Create/Update**: Uses Prisma transactions to ensure atomicity
- **Update behavior**: When exercises array is provided, ALL existing exercises are deleted and replaced
- **Exercise ordering**: Defaults to array index + 1 if not specified
- **Authorization**:
  - Athletes can view their routines (own + assigned by trainers)
  - Only routine creators can edit/delete routines
  - Trainers can assign routines to their athletes
- **Routine ownership**: `userId` = owner, `createdBy` = creator (may differ if trainer assigns to athlete)

### Validation

Uses `express-validator` with custom validators:
- Routine title: 1-100 chars
- Routine description: 0-500 chars (optional)
- Exercise name: 1-100 chars
- Exercise description: 0-500 chars (optional)
- RoutineExercise sets: 1-50
- RoutineExercise reps: 1-500
- RoutineExercise weight: 0-1000 kg (optional, accepts decimals)
- RoutineExercise rest: 0-3600 seconds (optional)
- RoutineExercise requires valid `exerciseId` from catalog

### Security Features

- **Rate limiting**: 100 requests/15min (general), 5 requests/15min (auth endpoints)
- **CORS**: Configured for localhost:3000 and localhost:5173 in dev
- **Helmet**: Security headers enabled
- **Body size limit**: 10mb JSON payloads
- **No password leakage**: User queries explicitly exclude password field

## Configuration

Required environment variables (see `.env`):
- `DATABASE_URL` - Prisma connection string (file:./dev.db for SQLite)
- `JWT_SECRET` - Secret key for JWT signing
- `PORT` - Server port (default: 4000)
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment (development/production/test)

## Testing

- **Framework**: Jest
- **Test files**: `tests/**/*.test.js`
- **Setup**: `tests/setup.js` runs before all tests
- **Coverage**: Excludes `src/server.js`
- **Environment**: Set to "node" for Jest

## Switching to PostgreSQL

1. Update `prisma/schema.prisma`: Change `provider = "sqlite"` to `provider = "postgresql"`
2. Update `DATABASE_URL` to PostgreSQL connection string
3. Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` in production (not `migrate dev`)

## API Endpoints

### Authentication (`/api/auth/*`)
- `POST /register` - Register new user (optional `role` field: ATHLETE/TRAINER)
- `POST /login` - Login and get JWT token
- `GET /profile` - Get current user profile (includes role)
- `PUT /profile` - Update user profile
- `POST /change-password` - Change user password

### Routines (`/api/routines/*`)
All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

**General (All authenticated users):**
- `GET /` - Get user's routines (athletes see own + assigned by trainers)
- `GET /stats` - Get routine statistics
- `GET /:id` - Get specific routine by ID
- `POST /` - Create new routine (sets self as owner and creator)
- `PUT /:id` - Update routine (only creator can update)
- `DELETE /:id` - Delete routine (only creator can delete)

**Trainer Only:**
- `POST /assign` - Assign routine to athlete
- `GET /athletes` - Get all trainer's athletes
- `POST /athletes` - Add athlete to trainer
- `DELETE /athletes/:athleteId` - Remove athlete from trainer

**Athlete Only:**
- `GET /trainers` - Get all athlete's trainers

### Exercises (`/api/exercises/*`)
All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

- `GET /` - Get all exercises from catalog
- `GET /:id` - Get specific exercise by ID
- `POST /` - Create new exercise (for admin/future use)
